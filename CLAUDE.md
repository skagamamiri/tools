# ICT HUB (skagamamiri/tools)

Hub Tool ICT for SK Agama (MIS) Miri, hosted on GitHub Pages at
https://skagamamiri.github.io/tools/. Backend is Firebase (project `skamis-hubtool`):
Google sign-in, with Firestore `teachers` collection as the whitelist.

## Conventions for tool pages

- Every tool is its own full page with its own URL (no iframes). `index.html` opens
  tools via `openToolPage()`: same-origin URL tools navigate directly, HTML-code tools
  from the admin panel open at `tool.html?id=<toolId>`, external URLs open in a new tab.
- **Every tool page uses the shared header** `ict-header.js`:
  `<script src="ict-header.js"></script>` in `<head>`, then
  `<ict-header icon="fa-solid ..." title="..." subtitle="..."></ict-header>` at the top of `<body>`.
  Start new tools from `_template-tool.html`.
- The header has **no logout button** and no login button. Put login UI in the page body.
  Set the user shown in the header with `ICTHeader.setUser(name, role)` (or the
  `#userName` / `#userRole` elements it renders); `ICTHeader.clearUser()` on sign-out.
- UI text is in Bahasa Melayu.

## Data

- `aktiviti` — school activities (aktiviti.html; shown on the index calendar). Public read.
- `roomBookings` — special-room bookings (tempahan.html). Activities with a room create
  linked bookings (`aktivitiId`, `sumber: "aktiviti"`). Read requires an active teacher.
- Room list is duplicated in `tempahan.html` and `aktiviti.html` (`ROOMS`); keep in sync.
- Firestore security rules are edited by the owner in the Firebase Console, not from here.
